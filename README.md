# Churn_Prediction
A classification project predicting customer churn using SQL for data preparation, Python for modelling, and Power BI for visual insights.

## Project Overview
The goal is to identify customers likely to churn and highlight revenue at risk. The workflow includes:
- SQL data extraction and basic cleaning
- Python-based feature preparation and model training
- Power BI dashboards for summarising churn patterns and predictions

## Tech Stack
- **SQL**: Data extraction and initial cleaning
- **Python**: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Power BI**: Dashboard for churn overview, and reports for drivers, and predictions

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~92%
- ROC AUC: ~0.86

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
